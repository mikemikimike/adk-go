// Package compaction summarizes older session events so an agent's prompt stays
// small as its conversation grows.
//
// A compaction never modifies or deletes history. Summarizing a range of events
// appends one new [session.Event] carrying a [session.EventCompaction] that
// records the covered timestamp range and the summary content. When the next
// prompt is built, the raw events inside that range are dropped and the summary
// is materialized in their place.
//
// # What each strategy achieves
//
// Sliding window replaces each group of invocations with one summary, but
// summaries are never themselves re-summarized. Prompt size therefore still
// grows with conversation length, at a reduced constant factor rather than
// being bounded.
//
// Tail retention is what bounds it: each new summary is seeded with the
// previous one, so history stays as a single rolling summary plus a raw tail.
// An agent that needs a genuine ceiling on prompt size should enable it.
//
// # Enabling both together
//
// Both strategies can be enabled at once, and they compose, but only when the
// sliding window leaves tail retention something to do.
//
// They share a candidate rule: tail retention summarizes the events no
// compaction already covers, and the sliding window covers everything it
// reaches, every CompactionInterval invocations. So tail retention fires only
// when more events have accumulated since the last sliding-window compaction
// than EventRetentionSize holds back. A short interval keeps that number small,
// and with a large retention size it never reaches it: tail retention never
// runs, and the prompt grows with the conversation as though it were not
// configured at all.
//
// Measured end to end over 60 turns, with a summary of about 500 characters:
//
//	CompactionInterval   EventRetentionSize   final prompt
//	2                    10                   13,935 characters, growing
//	3                    10                    9,147 characters, growing
//	10                   10                       543 characters, bounded
//	20                    2                       495 characters, bounded
//	off                  10                       543 characters, bounded
//
// The rule of thumb is that EventRetentionSize has to be smaller than the
// events one compaction interval produces. Tail retention alone is the
// configuration that needs no arithmetic, and it is what an agent that wants a
// ceiling should reach for first.
//
// Compaction is enabled per runner. See the EventsCompactionConfig field on
// runner.Config:
//
//	r, err := runner.New(runner.Config{
//		AppName:        "my-app",
//		Agent:          rootAgent,
//		SessionService: session.InMemoryService(),
//		EventsCompactionConfig: &compaction.Config{
//			CompactionInterval: 3,
//			OverlapSize:        1,
//		},
//	})

// ErrCompaction marks an error as a compaction failure rather than a failure of

//
// Compaction is bookkeeping: the events of the turn are already persisted
// before it runs, so a failure costs a smaller prompt later, not the user's
// answer. It still surfaces, because a summarizer that never succeeds is worth
// knowing about, but a caller that would rather log it than fail the turn can
// tell the two apart:
//
//	for event, err := range r.Run(...) {
//		if errors.Is(err, compaction.ErrCompaction) {
//			log.Printf("compaction failed: %v", err)
//			continue

// Config configures context compaction for an application.
//
// Two strategies are available, and at least one must be enabled. A Config that
// enables neither is rejected by [Config.Validate], because it would cost a
// configuration step and do nothing; leave the whole Config nil to disable
// compaction:
//
//   - Sliding window (CompactionInterval, OverlapSize) runs after an invocation
//     completes and summarizes whole invocations at a time.
//   - Tail retention (TokenThreshold, EventRetentionSize) runs inside an
//     invocation before a model call and summarizes everything but the most
//     recent events once the prompt grows past a token budget.
//
// Both can be enabled at once and they compose, but not at every setting: the
// sliding window consumes the events tail retention would otherwise summarize,
// so tail retention only fires when more events accumulate between windows than
// EventRetentionSize holds back. A short interval with a large retention size
// leaves it permanently idle and the prompt unbounded. See the package
// documentation for the measurements. Tail retention alone needs no such
// arithmetic.
type Config struct {
	// CompactionInterval is the number of new user-initiated invocations that,
	// once fully represented in the session's events, triggers a sliding-window
	// compaction. Zero, the default, disables sliding-window compaction.
	//
	// It also bounds the window: one compaction covers at most this many new
	// invocations, so enabling compaction on a session that already has a long
	// history drains the backlog a window at a time rather than summarizing all
	// of it in one call.
	CompactionInterval int

	// OverlapSize is how many already-compacted invocations to pull back into
	// the next sliding window, creating an overlap between consecutive
	// summaries for continuity. Only meaningful alongside CompactionInterval.
	//
	// The overlap is repeated, not shared: an invocation pulled back in is
	// described by both summaries, so the model sees it twice and the prompt
	// carries roughly OverlapSize invocations of extra text per summary. That
	// is the cost of the continuity, and it cannot be trimmed away afterwards,
	// because by then the repetition lives inside summary prose rather than in
	// the ranges. Leave it at zero unless summaries are visibly losing the
	// thread between windows.
	OverlapSize int

	// TokenThreshold is the prompt token count at which intra-invocation
	// tail-retention compaction fires before a model call. Zero, the default,
	// disables tail-retention compaction.
	//
	// Summaries produced by this strategy do not pass through the plugin
	// pipeline. The sliding window runs after an invocation and its summary
	// takes the runner's normal append path, where a plugin sees it like any
	// other event. Tail retention runs inside an invocation and appends
	// directly, so a plugin does not see it. An application relying on a plugin
	// to redact content before it is stored should know these events bypass it,
	// because nothing reports that they did.
	//
	// Neither ADK Kotlin nor adk-python runs a plugin hook on either compaction
	// path: SlidingWindowEventCompactor, TokenThresholdEventCompactor and
	// CompactionRequestProcessor all append straight through the session
	// service. Kotlin is the closer reference here, because this stack's design
	// was adapted from its compaction document.
	//
	// Parity is why it is written down, not why it is right. adk-python's
	// compaction has no exclusions, no positional guard and no race check, so
	// "the reference does this" is evidence about consistency and not about
	// safety. The reason to leave it is that running plugins inside an
	// invocation is a behaviour change, and the reason to document it is that a
	// silent gap in a redaction path is worse than a stated one.
	TokenThreshold int

	// EventRetentionSize is how many of the most recent events are kept raw
	// when tail-retention compaction fires. Everything older is summarized.
	// Only meaningful alongside TokenThreshold, and required with it: at zero
	// the window would extend to the newest event, which includes the question
	// the model is about to answer, so the turn in progress would be summarized
	// out of its own prompt.
	EventRetentionSize int
